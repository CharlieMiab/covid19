# 3D-printed Face Shield/Visor Design Files

A place for any design files suited to 3D printing.  PETG is the preferred material for any 3D-printed parts, but PLA seems to be acceptable if that's all that's available.

So far we've looked at the following:

# Prusa Protective Face Shield

https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/25857-prusa-protective-face-shield-rc2 

(Despite the name this is RC3 - it does mention that RC1 and RC2 are still relevant, depending on requirements)

RC1 /RC2 stacked to print 4 at once:

# 3DVerkstan / Hospital Marañón

These are similar - the Spanish one (used by Hospital Marañón in Madrid), is based on 3DVerkstan one and optimised for their requirements.

## 3DVerkstan

This is the design that Jo Hinchliffe and the folk in North Wales are printing.

[Our local copy of the files](3DVerkstan) and we're using the [Visor_frame_EUROPE_80mm_4hole_v1.stl](3DVerkstan/Visor_frame_EUROPE_80mm_4hole_v1.stl) version.

## Hospital Marañón

- Layer Height : 0.3mm
- Base and top layers 3
- Wall thickness 3
- Infill 20%, triangular
- No support
- Print Speed: Operator to decide

## Liverpool Uni

The folk at Liverpool Uni are also churning out visors.  The design they're using seems based on the Prusa, and there's a [copy of their design here](LiverpoolUni/).
