# Face Shield/Visor Designs

We have [all of this equipment](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/wiki/Equipment) in the space, so for the visor designs we're looking at both laser-cut and 3D printed options.

## Design Notes/Requirements

 * [The ones we are using are a trip of foam glued to a clear sheet with elastic to hold it on. They are supposed to be single use.](https://twitter.com/doctorfraz/status/1242558629317926916)
 * [Ideally should fit with other parts of a uniform or alone to protect against splatter/ spray with room for headwear, mask & glasses/goggles. Should be secure around head/adjustable](https://twitter.com/AlyssaAlabassi/status/1242564096454688771)  Here's a [photo of current(?) solutions and the uniform, etc.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1742/1*v6C5oJn1kBSdlUgOFLpQbQ.jpeg)
 * Foam design is [very similar to what we are currently using in ED.
We have brief contact times with patients & get through lots. Other areas e.g. ICU may need something more resilient](https://twitter.com/doctorfraz/status/1242566514454278150)
 * On sterilisation/cleaning: [Should be single use. Might be worth contacting Primary care groups as GPs have no PPE at present so can't see patients many of whom could stay at home](https://twitter.com/doctorfraz/status/1242567550820646914) / [face shields should be able to be decontaminated between patients with bleach- we use acticlor solution in our trust and it's deemed to be good for viral contamination. I think risk of transmission to HCP low and risk of cross contamination 2 next pt lower](https://twitter.com/bom_tarnes/status/1242567517551374342) / [If they're not disposable then they should be easy to clean. I don't know how foam will fare. Depends on where they're being used: everyday outpatients/GP surgery/ pharmacies are different from intensive care units and high infection wards.](https://twitter.com/AlyssaAlabassi/status/1242568887104872448)
 * [To be honest I think that foam head band would be better than the large gap at the top of this one. It is droplet spread so a sneeze or cough while swabbing would go straight through that space

## Materials notes

 * [from my prior involvement in medical 3d printing, PLA and ABS aren't ideal as they end up being porous and trap particulate contaminants. PETG is better and my prior medical designs use this.](https://twitter.com/bom_tarnes/status/1242569448902533122)
 * [Best place for foam sheets is a proper musicians shop. One in Blackpool. Used to line flight cases etc.](https://twitter.com/dunkerley21/status/1242573638454456320)

## Designs Evaluated

TODO Fill this in with proper links, etc.

In the mean time, check out [this Twitter thread of our initial prototyping](https://twitter.com/amcewen/status/1242826238630248449) and [the most recent videos on our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/DoESLiverpool)
