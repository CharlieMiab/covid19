# DoES Liverpool's COVID-19 Help

A location for our face visor (and other?) help during the COVID-19 pandemic

This repository has been spun out of [this initial issue on the topic](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/issues/1415) because (a) it looks like we'll be making some visors and (b) trying to manage that in one issue thread is getting unwieldy.

Lots of makers are looking to help across the world, and that's where we're getting a lot of our information, designs, and inspiration.  This repo is (probably) going to focus on what we can and are doing at [DoES Liverpool](https://doesliverpool.com), generally for Liverpool and nearby.

That said, we know lots of other makers across the country, so can connect people up if you need it.  And here are some links to other initiatives to check out:

  * TODO - Add any links to other people running at this
  * CoVid19 Volunteers Slack is gaining a lot of traction. You can join the north-west-england group with the invitation [here](https://join.slack.com/share/I010P6XJUAD/baOoy2VWZjrnHGeAeDYJ58hX/enQtMTAyMzIzNTY0MDM1My01Y2ZjYTljYjNmZGY4OTA4MDdmZDUyNjFiYzYxMjRkY2Y1NGFjYjEwMjc5NzJlMjJmOTU2YjQ3ZjA5MTVmNmI5)

## Current Work

  * Mostly we're looking at making [face shields/visors to help with the PPE shortage for health professionals](FaceShield.md)
  * There are some other [COVID-19-related projects over on the regular "somebody should" issue tracker](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/labels/COVID-19)

This page (and others in the repository) are for hold information about the work we've done.  To manage the work itself, we'll spin tasks out as [individual issues over here](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/covid19/issues).  There's also a general ["I can help" issue](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/covid19/issues/1) where you can show up to volunteer :-)

If you want to get emails when there are new issues or comments, click the "Watch" button up at the top of the page.

If all this talk of issues, etc. is confusing, our general ["how to help at DoES Liverpool" page](https://doesliverpool.com/make-things-better/) might help, or feel free to ask us on social media or [drop us an email](mailto:hello@doesliverpool.com).

### Masks

>A study from City University of Hong Kong found that the efficacy of a mask made at home out of two pieces of paper towel + a tissue “…were proven to have achieved 80 to 90 per cent of the function of regular surgical masks in terms of their filtration of aerosol and droplets.
